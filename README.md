# Harvard Architecture 8-bit Processor (Verilog)

## Overview

This project implements a **custom 8-bit Harvard Architecture Processor** using **Verilog HDL**.
The processor features separate **instruction memory and data memory**, a **32-register file**, and an **8-bit ALU capable of arithmetic, logical, and shift operations**.

The processor executes **32-bit instructions** and supports a variety of operations including **data movement, arithmetic, logic, multiplication, division, and memory access**.

The design was developed and simulated using the **Cadence VLSI toolchain**.

# Processor Architecture

![Processor Architecture](docs/architecture.png)

The processor consists of the following major components:

* **Program Counter (PC)** – Generates instruction addresses.
* **Instruction Memory** – Stores 64 instructions (32-bit each).
* **Decode Unit** – Decodes opcode and extracts register operands.
* **Register File** – 32 registers each of 8 bits.
* **ALU** – Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
* **Data Memory** – 256 memory locations for load/store operations.
* **Writeback Unit** – Writes computation results back to registers.

# Instruction Format

![Instruction Format](docs/instruction_format.png)

The processor supports multiple instruction formats depending on the operation type:

### Immediate Instruction

```
Opcode (6) | Rdst (5) | Reserved (13) | Immediate (8)
```

### Register Move

```
Opcode (6) | Rdst (5) | Reserved (16) | Rsrc (5)
```

### Load Instruction

```
Opcode (6) | Rdst (5) | Reserved (13) | Src Address (8)
```

### Store Instruction

```
Opcode (6) | Dst Address (8) | Reserved (13) | Rsrc (5)
```

### Arithmetic / Logic Instructions

```
Opcode (6) | Rdst2 (5) | Rdst1 (5) | Reserved (6) | Rsrc2 (5) | Rsrc1 (5)
```

# Instruction Set

![Instruction Set](docs/instruction_set.png)
